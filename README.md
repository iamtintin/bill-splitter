# Bill Splitter

This Web-App is a bill splitter which uses a Flask and SQLlite back-end. 

The Bill Splitter works on the idea that users can form groups called parties, to which bills can be assigned. In order to form a party, the user creating the party, must be friends with all the proposed members of the party. A friend is created by a user sending a friend request to another user, who then accepts the request.
